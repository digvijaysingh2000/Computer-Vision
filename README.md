## Overview
* In Covid 19 Mask Detector we used OpenCV, Tensorflow/Keras, and Deep Learning.
* It can automatically detect whether people in the image are wearing masks or not.
* Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether people in the image are wearing a mask or not.

## Motivation
* In these difficult times of pandemic, there is a growing need to wear a mask.
* But many people have started neglecting the necessity of a mask.
* A mask not only protects the wearer, but also stops the transmission of the deadly virus.
* So, our model will help us to keep a check on the people whether they are wearing a mask or not.

## Libraries used
* OpenCV
* Tensorflow/Keras
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Generating the Training Data
* Imported the dataset, and retained only those images with a classname either 'face_with_mask' or 'face_without_mask'.
* Generated the training and testing sets of unique images.
* Created a new column containing the coordinates of bounding box(es), and wrote a function to draw them.
* Constructed the final training data by cropping it to the bounding boxes.
* Normalized the training data before feeding in the model.

## Impact and Future Scope
* Our model can be used to keep a check on people, whether they are obeying the pandemic guidelines or not, in crowded areas.
* It can be improved to use in CCTV cameras by adding a video feature.
